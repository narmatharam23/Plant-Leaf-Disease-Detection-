ðŸŒ¿ Plant Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a **Plant Leaf Disease Detection** system that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to identify plant species from leaf images and detect whether the leaf is healthy or affected by a disease. If diseased, it predicts the specific disease and suggests remedies.

The model is trained on a well-structured dataset of plant leaves, categorized by plant type and disease type. It provides accurate predictions when given a leaf image as input.

ðŸ›  Features

- âœ… Detect **Disease Name** or **Healthy** status  
- âœ… Suggest remedies for detected diseases  
- âœ… Web-based interface for easy image upload and result viewing  
- âœ… Pre-trained CNN model for fast predictions
